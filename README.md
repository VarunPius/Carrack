# Carrack
The purpose of this repository is to set out to build a simple Stock trading application. 

## Name
A carrack was a type of easily maneuverable ships, large enough to be stable in heavy seas, and for a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages. They were first used for European trade from the Mediterranean to the Baltic and quickly found use with long expeditions which eventually led to the discovering of Americas. Most popular of the carrack was *Santa Maria*, used by Christopher Columbus to discover the new land and it's riches. Carracks soon evolved into huge galleons , which were nothing my armed cargo vessels bigger than carracks, that brought riches to the kingdoms building and sponsoring them

This is the what the intent of this application is. To evolve from a small easily *maneuverable* application to a fully functional one capable of performing much more complex operations.
